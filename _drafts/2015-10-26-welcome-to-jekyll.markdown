To add new posts, simply add a file (like this one) in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown`. Take a look at this post to get an idea about how it works.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com).

## Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## Images

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

## Quotes

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway
